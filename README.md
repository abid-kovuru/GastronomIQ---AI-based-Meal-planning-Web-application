GastronomIQ is an innovative project leveraging Artificial Intelligence (AI), Natural Language
Processing (NLP), and greedy optimization algorithms to revolutionize meal planning. Utilizing Python
libraries such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, and scikit-learn, GastronomIQ integrates advanced AI techniques to
analyze and predict user preferences. NLP libraries, including NLTK and spaCy, process and understand user
inputs, such as dietary restrictions, favorite cuisines, and meal preferences, generating highly personalized meal
plans. The system employs greedy optimization to efficiently allocate ingredients and recipes, ensuring costeffectiveness and minimizing food waste. By dynamically adjusting meal plans based on user feedback and
seasonal ingredient availability, GastronomIQ offers a highly adaptive and user- centric solution. The project
also features an intuitive user interface that facilitates seamless interaction and real-time adjustments to meal
plans. GastronomIQ aims to enhance the meal planning experience by providing users with tailored, nutritious,
and delicious meal options, ultimately promoting healthier eating habits and reducing the environmental impact
of food consumption. Through its sophisticated use of Python and NLP libraries, AI methodologies, and
optimization techniques, GastronomIQ stands at the forefront of smart meal planning technology. In conclusion,
GastronomIQ offers a practical and intelligent approach to daily nutrition management, setting a new standard
in personalized meal planning solutions.
